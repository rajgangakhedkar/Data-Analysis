Project Findings – Sales & Shipment Analysis:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology Leads in Sales
Technology is the top-selling product category, contributing 36.6% of total revenue. High-ticket tech products such as the Canon imageCLASS 2200 Copier consistently drive sales, with a single product generating $61K alone. This suggests that focusing marketing or bundling strategies around tech products could boost revenue further.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customer Engagement Varies Widely
Out of 793 users:
- 527 are Regular (purchased in the last 3 months)
- 96 are Occasional (purchased in 3-6 months)
- 170 are Inactive (>6 months)
This shows a healthy base of engaged customers, but also highlights a retention gap — targeting inactive users with re-engagement campaigns could increase conversions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year-over-Year Sales Trends Show Strong Growth
Sales grew from $459K in 2016 to $722K in 2018, a 57% increase over two years. The strongest growth came in 2017 (+30.6% YoY), indicating successful momentum that should be sustained. A dip in 2016 sales (-4.3%) could reflect seasonal or operational issues worth further investigation.

California & New York Dominate Sales — But Also Delays
Top States by Sales:
- California: $446K
- New York: $306K
However, these states also lead in shipment delays, especially postal codes in New York (10035, 10024, etc.). This points to logistics bottlenecks in key markets — improving delivery in these areas could improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shipments Face Reliability Challenges
1,586 delayed shipments were recorded, with Standard Class being the most delayed mode (2,944 delays). Tuesdays and Saturdays are the most delay-prone days. The West and East regions have the highest number of delays.
These trends indicate the need to:
- Re-evaluate shipping partner performance
- Adjust logistics planning on high-delay weekdays
- Use this insight to negotiate SLAs or improve delivery tracking.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consistent Top Products Drive Monthly Performance
Each month is dominated by a standout product, showing strong seasonal trends.
For example:
- Mar: Cisco Videoconferencing System → $22.6K
- Oct: Canon Copier → $28.7K
This insight can inform inventory planning, seasonal promotions, and stock prioritization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delayed Shipment Risk Can Be Geographically Targeted
Most delays are clustered in a few postal codes and regions.
For example:
- 10035 (New York): 85 delays
- 94122 (California): 64 delays
This suggests an opportunity for localized interventions — like alternate courier partnerships or fulfillment centers in those areas.
